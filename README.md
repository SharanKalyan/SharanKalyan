Welcome to my profile! 

I am a Data Science professional and AI enthusiast with six years of hands-on experience across the AI/ML technology stack. I currently lead a high-performance data science team of four at a US-based firm, working from Chennai as a Senior Team Lead.
My work spans Smart City projects where object detection algorithms such as YOLO, TensorFlow, and PyTorch play a major role. I’ve personally contributed to numerous such initiatives, many of which are showcased on my GitHub. Beyond deep learning, I also have strong experience in statistical modeling, data analysis, and advanced visualizations using Python and BI tools like Tableau and Power BI. 
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from Anna University (2018) and completed my PGP in Data Science from Great Lakes in 2019. Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work in both startups and MNCs, giving me a well-rounded perspective across different work environments.

⚡ Fun fact : I am a passionate cricketer! I even wanted to become a cricketer. Since I have good understanding and interest on cricket, I have been actively analysing the datasets related to cricket which you can see on my github! I have also been actively participating on many competitions hosted by Kaggle.com and analyticsvidhya.com!
