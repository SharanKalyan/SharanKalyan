Welcome to my profile! 

I am a Datascience and an analytics professional with 2 years worth of rich experience across the analytics technology stack! I have experience working on Smart city projects where Object detection algorithms like the Yolo plays a majour role! I have personally been working on many such projects which you can see on this git. However, I have more experience working on the statitical models and analysis. I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering, Panimalar Institute of Technology in 2018, and my PGP in Data Science with Great Lakes in 2019. I have experience working for both startups as well as MNC's! I am currently working 
for HDFC Bank, Chennai as a Functional Analyst.


‚ö° Fun fact : I am a passionate cricketer! I even wanted to become a cricketer. I have represented India in an Under 17 tournament for my club! (Madras Gladiators) Since I have good knowledge on cricket, I have been actively analysing the datasets related to cricket which you can see in this profile! I have also been actively participating on many competitions hosted by Kaggle.com and analyticsvidhya.com!
